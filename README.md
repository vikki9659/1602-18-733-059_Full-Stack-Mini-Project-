Introduction :

If  a student fails to get his hall ticket on the semester end examination day , then the traditional process of solving this problem is to go to the stationary and get a form , fill it , pay the required amount as a fine and at last get the form signed from the concerned authorities , only then the student will be allowed to sit for the exam. The total time for this entire  trip would be around 20-30 minutes, The only purpose of this project is to reduce the total time and make the student get rid of any kind of fear/chaos on the examination day.

Solution : 
To solve this problem we have developed a prototype kind of platform where a student need to just enter the hall ticket number and then the hall ticket will be displayed and he/she can go and get it printed.
